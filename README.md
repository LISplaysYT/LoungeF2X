This is a small unblocked games website I am making so I can have fun in school so most of the links are hosted by Replit. I am work on adding new games and making it use vercel links as anything in iframes are unblocked on most of the school blockers. I have tested it on GoGuardian and Securly but from what I have seen it works on any. Join our discord to suggest games / report bugs / or just chat with the Community!
